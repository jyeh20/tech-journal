# InnateDomain

The InnateDomain project is the first project based on the Zeus domain. This project seeks to make my anime poster collection come to life through the use of neopixel LEDs.

## Technology

### Raspberry Pi Pico W

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is Raspberry Pi's smallest microcontroller. With a 2MB flash and Wifi and
Bluetooth capabilities, this was the perfect solution for a lightweight contraption to slap onto the back
of a picture frame. It's thin form factor could be attached without being noticed.

## Frontend

### MicroPython

MicroPython is a Python library optimized for running on a microcontroller. I have programmed Arduino's
with C++ previously, but Python is my language of choice. So far, it has not given me any problems and optimization for this type of project is not a total concern.
